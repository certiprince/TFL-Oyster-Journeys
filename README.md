# TFL Oyster Card Journeys Analysis
London is a major world capital in many sectors, though perhaps most notably in finance. With a booming economy, people are flocking to the city from all around the world, attracting by the thriving job market and high standards of living.
This has caused its population to increase steadily and consistently since the 1970s, and most notably since the 1990s.
In 2011, the Current London Plan [[1]](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-one-context-and-strategy-0) predicted:
> ... Londonâ€™s population rising from 8.2 million in 2011, to:
>
>9.20 million in 2021;
>9.54 million in 2026;
>9.84 million in 2031; and
>10.11 million in 2036.

So far their estimations have proved accurate; current estimates put the population of London at around 9.3 million. [[2]](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/london-population/)

With a growing population, London's roads are becoming more congested and the TFL network is struggling to cope. Never was this more obvious than at the height of the COVID-19 crisis in early March this year.

In this notebook I will analyse a dataset containing information on TFL Oyster card journeys across a 7-day period in November 2009 to draw some insights on the TFL network to highlight the key problem areas that need to be addressed.

The dataset was collected by a classmate of mine in the UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, please find it here: [TFL Oyster Journeys '09](https://www.kaggle.com/astronasko/transport-for-london-journey-information)
